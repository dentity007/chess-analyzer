"""Chess.com API Client - Professional Chess Data Integration.

This module provides a comprehensive, production-ready client for interacting
with the Chess.com Public API. It supports both anonymous and authenticated
access with robust error handling and rate limiting.

Core Features:
- Public API integration without authentication requirements
- Optional credential support for future premium features
- Intelligent rate limiting to respect API guidelines
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- Local credential storage with security best practices
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent usage

API Endpoints Supported:
- Player profiles and statistics
- Game archives and individual games
- Monthly game collections
- Tournament data and results
- Leaderboards and rankings

Security Features:
- Local credential storage in config.local.ini (automatically gitignored)
- No transmission of sensitive data over network
- Secure password handling and validation
- Environment variable support for CI/CD

Technical Features:
- HTTP session reuse for performance
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- JSON response parsing and validation
- PyInstaller-compatible path resolution
- Comprehensive logging and debugging support

Usage Examples:
    # Basic usage (no authentication required)
    client = ChessComClient()
    games = client.get_all_games('magnuscarlsen')

    # With authentication (for future premium features)
    client = ChessComClient()
    client.username = 'your_username'
    client.password = 'your_password'
    if client.test_authentication():
        print("Authentication successful")

Configuration:
    Create config.local.ini in project root:
    [chess_com]
    username = your_chess_username
    password = your_password

Dependencies:
- requests: HTTP client for API communication
- configparser: Configuration file parsing
- datetime: Date and time handling
- json: JSON response processing
