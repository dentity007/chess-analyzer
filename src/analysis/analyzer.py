"""Chess Analysis Engine - Stockfish Integration for Game Evaluation.

This module provides a comprehensive chess analysis engine using the Stockfish
chess engine for move evaluation, blunder detection, and position assessment.
It offers both individual move analysis and complete game evaluation.

Core Features:
- Stockfish chess engine integration with automatic detection
- Move-by-move position evaluation with centipawn scores
- Blunder detection based on evaluation drops
- Game phase classification (opening, middlegame, endgame)
- Best move suggestions for each position
- Batch analysis for multiple games

Analysis Capabilities:
- Position evaluation: Static position strength assessment
- Move quality analysis: Evaluation change after each move
- Blunder detection: Significant evaluation drops (>200 cp)
- Accuracy calculation: Overall game accuracy percentage
- Tactical analysis: Identification of winning/losing positions
- Time-based analysis: Depth and time-controlled evaluation

Technical Features:
- Automatic Stockfish binary detection in common locations
- Configurable analysis depth and time limits
- Memory-efficient PGN parsing and game handling
- Thread-safe analysis operations
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- PyInstaller-compatible binary detection

Performance Optimizations:
- Engine process reuse to minimize startup overhead
- Intelligent time management for analysis depth
- Memory-efficient game representation
- Caching of repeated position evaluations
- Parallel analysis support for multiple games

Usage Examples:
    # Initialize analyzer
    analyzer = ChessAnalyzer()

    # Analyze complete game
    results = analyzer.analyze_game(pgn_string)

    # Analyze specific position
    evaluation = analyzer.evaluate_position(fen_string)

    # Detect blunders in game
    blunders = analyzer.find_blunders(game_moves)

Configuration:
    Stockfish binary locations (auto-detected):
    - /usr/local/bin/stockfish (macOS/Linux)
    - /usr/bin/stockfish (Linux)
    - ./stockfish (project directory)
    - System PATH

Error Handling:
- Graceful fallback when Stockfish is not available
- Warning messages for analysis limitations
- Exception handling for engine communication errors
- Recovery mechanisms for interrupted analysis

Dependencies:
- chess: Python chess library for board representation
- chess.engine: Stockfish engine communication
- chess.pgn: PGN parsing and game handling
- pathlib: Cross-platform path operations
- typing: Type hints for better documentation
