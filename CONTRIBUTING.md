## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- (Optional) Stockfish chess engine

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Fork the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-analyzer.git
cd chess-analyzer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# (Optional) Configure local credentials for testing
# Create config.local.ini with your Chess.com credentials
cp config.local.ini.example config.local.ini
# Edit config.local.ini with your credentials (never commit this file!)

# Run tests to ensure everything works
pytest tests/

# Test authentication setup
python -m src.main auth-test

# Start developing
python -m src.main --gui
```

## üìã Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue
- Check [open issues](https://github.com/yourusername/chess-analyzer/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Follow our [Code Style Guidelines](#code-style)
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Test your changes thoroughly

### 4. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
```

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `test:` for tests
- `refactor:` for code refactoring

### 5. Push and Create PR
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```
Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## üéØ Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values

### Example
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def analyze_games(games: List[dict], username: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    """
    Analyze a list of chess games for a specific user.

    Args:
        games: List of game dictionaries
        username: Chess.com username

    Returns:
        Analysis results or None if no games
    """
    if not games:
        return None

    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Document all public functions and classes
- Include type hints
- Provide usage examples where helpful

### Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ChessAnalyzer`)
- **Functions/Methods**: `snake_case` (e.g., `analyze_game`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_DEPTH`)
- **Private**: Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_helper_function`)

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific tests
pytest tests/test_api_client.py -v

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_analyze" -v
```

### Writing Tests
- Use `pytest` framework
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Name test files as `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_do_something`
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, etc.)

### Test Structure
```python
import pytest
from src.api.client import ChessComClient

class TestChessComClient:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures."""
        self.client = ChessComClient()

    def test_get_player_profile_success(self):
        """Test successful player profile retrieval."""
        # Test implementation
        pass

    def test_get_player_profile_error(self):
        """Test error handling for profile retrieval."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```

## üìö Documentation

- Update changelog for significant changes

## üîí Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- **Never commit credentials** to version control
- Use `config.local.ini` for local development credentials
- This file is automatically excluded by `.gitignore`
- For testing, use test accounts with minimal privileges

### API Security
- Respect rate limits when working with Chess.com API
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Don't expose sensitive information in logs
- Use HTTPS for all external communications

### Code Security
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Reporting Security Issues
- Report security vulnerabilities to: security@chess-analyzer.dev
- Don't create public issues for security problems
- Allow time for fixes before public disclosure
